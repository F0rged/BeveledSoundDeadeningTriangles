# BeveledSoundDeadeningTriangles
3D Printed Sound Deadening Triangles

These triangles are designed to hold some form of sound deadening foam.
I used some audio foam that a friend gave me, but you could also use something like roxul safe and sound.

I used a thin piece of wood as a backing, with 3d printed corners, and aluminum tiling edge to connect them:

Note that these corners are specifically designed for this specific tiling edge such that they snap in.
